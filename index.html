    <h2>Alternative actors as Main actor</h2>
    <p>I particularly think these four actors could have played
        as the main character in Oppenheimer. Each of them have unique talents
        and styles that could have given the film a different feel.</p>

    <h2>Creating your own data stream in Python</h2>
    <p>The processor function and Processor class read data, use a converter to transform it,
         and then write the processed data as part of the data processing pipeline defined by 
         this Python code. In order to perform actual data transformation, the converter technique
          must be used as a stand-in.</p>

    <pre>
        def processor(reader, converter, writer):
            while True:
                data = reader.read()
                if not data:
                    break
                data = converter(data)
                writer.write(data)
        
        class Processor:
            def __init__(self, reader, writer):
                self.reader = reader
                self.writer = writer
        
            def process(self):
                while True:
                    data = self.reader.readline()
                    if not data:
                        break
                    data = self.converter(data)
                    self.writer.write(data)
        
            def converter(data):
                assert False, 'converter must be defined'
